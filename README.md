Developers
----------

This project was first built on Xcode 4.2 GM under Mac OS Lion 10.7.2 GM. I have no idea of what happens if you try to compile this with either earlier versions of Xcode or earlier versions of OS X. The binary release was only designed for and tested on OS X Lion 10.7 and may or may not run on earlier versions of OS X.
